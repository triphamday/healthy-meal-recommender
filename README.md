# 🥗 Healthy Meal Recommender



### Project Overview

This project aims to **promote healthy eating habits** by recommending nutritious recipes tailored to your preferences — based on ingredients, dietary needs, and nutrition data — using machine learning techniques.

### Data Collection

- **Sources**:  
  - Food.com (500k+ recipes, regularly updated)  
  - EatingWell (Award-winning nutrition site, millions of monthly visitors)  

- **Tool**: Selenium for precise and reliable scraping.

- **Dataset Summary**:  
  - Combined dataset contains **11,102 recipes**.  
  - Features: title, ingredients, cooking instructions, calories, fats, cholesterol, sodium, carbs, fiber, sugars, protein, and diet labels.

### Data Preprocessing

- Clean, merge and standardize data from multiple sources.  
- Extract ingredient quantities and units with `ingredient_parser`.  
- Fill missing nutritional info where necessary.  
- Normalize nutritional data for modeling.  
- Evaluate data quality based on:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Completeness  
  - Consistency  
  - Timeliness  
  - Relevance  

### Modeling

- Algorithm: **Nearest Neighbors** with brute-force search and **cosine similarity**.  
- Purpose: Find and recommend nutritionally similar and ingredient-relevant healthy recipes.  
- Pipeline:  
  - Load & clean data  
  - Scale nutritional features  
  - Vectorize text (ingredients, instructions) with TF-IDF  
  - Filter by nutritional thresholds  
  - Recommend top matching recipes  

### Deployment & Demo

- Web app built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction.  
- Backend API powered by **FastAPI** for scalability.  
- **Ngrok** for exposing local server to public internet.
